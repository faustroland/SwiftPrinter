and upload your PNG image.

For rectangle canvas, I am using 1024x1440, but feel free experiment with different resolutions

To get the invention and license go to room: SwiftPrinter in RecRoom

TIP: Take photo of the license number and retype it into the photo description - you can copy it from there.
TIP: Check SwiftPrinter.jpg if you struggle with connecting all the parts together.
